<h1> About </h1>

<p>
I am a fourth year CS undergrad at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad campus.
My research interests lie broadly in natural language processing and machine learning.

I also use this website to write about research that interests me. Some of my earlier projects and experiences are also documented here.
