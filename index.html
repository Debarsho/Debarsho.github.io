I am a <a href=https://research.google/careers/ai-residency/>Google AI Resident</a> based out of Mountain View, California. Previously, I spent four amazing years studying Computer Science at <a href=https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/>BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus</a>. I also spent time as an intern advised by <a href=https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/amitsheth.php>Professor Amit Sheth</a>.

<p>
My research interests lie broadly in natural language processing and machine learning.
</p>

<p>
I also use this website to blog about research that interests me. Some of my earlier projects and experiences are also documented here.

<p>
In my spare time, I enjoy gaming and playing football (read: soccer).
