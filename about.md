My name is Vamsi Aribandi, and I'm a fourth year CS undergrad at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad campus.
My research interests lie broadly in natural language processing and machine learning.

I use this blog to write about research that interests me. Some of my earlier projects/experiences are also documented here.
